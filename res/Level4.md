## Level 3:

Congratulations on saving the robot! You can't make many useful programs without knowing how to utilize arithmetic operations and loops! 

To create loop in Wasm, the loop block is used. When the loop guard is true, the program execution must jump to the start of the loop. 

**Task:** Have the robot move forward **63** squares by using a for loop within the main function and calling move repeatedly.    

**Sample Code Result:** creating a loop in assembly that iterates over the integers from 0 through 4, inclusive.
