## Level 4: 

Now it is time for you to make your first Wasm function that utilizes input parameters! 

Function definitions also have optional clauses for input parameters and results. The keywords for parameters and results are "param" and "result" respectively. 

There is one parameter clause for each input in the form (param var_name var_type). For example, var_type could be i32. A result clause would be in the form (result result_type).  

**Task:** Create a function moveNTimes that causes the robot to move forward the number of times corresponding to the argument that is passed. 
The function takes one i32 parameter and returns nothing. Finally, tell the robot to move forward 40 steps by calling this function.   

**Hint:** Make sure to create a for loop within the function moveNTimes

**Sample Code Result:**  Calling the $IncrementAndPrint this will increment the input value by one and print it
