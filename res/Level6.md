## Level 6:

The Great Invisible Monster of Wasm painted over part of the Robot Master's scroll, and an important number is hidden. 

Luckily, the Robot Master's recipe for determining this number is still available. 
The readable part of the scroll reads: 

*"There is a variable equal to 20. There is a second variable initially equal to four times the first one. The robot must travel the product of the two variables minus the second variable."*  

It is important to keep in mind that Wasm uses a stack structure for variables and function calls. 

**Hint:** the code for the subtract operation is sub and the code for the multiplication operation is mul

**Hint 2:** The second number loaded on the stack will be subtracted from the first number loaded on the stack

**Hint 3:** You can call the moveNForward function with an argument as the computed value

**Sample Code Result:** This program will add the numbers 28 and 40.
