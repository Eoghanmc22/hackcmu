## Level 0

Welcome to level 0! Wasm is an amazing language, and we are very happy that you are interested in learning it! It's time to call your function in assembly!

Wasm is a versatile assembly language that utilizes a stack environment. A module is the fundamental, overarching unit in a Wasm environment, and functions 
and other code are written inside. The primary blocks that will occur within the wasm module will be function blocks, which can then be executed by the command (start function_name).
