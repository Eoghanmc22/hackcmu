## Level 6:

Congratulations Wasm Master! You have reached the final level! To celebrate, the robot would like to move in a giant spiral!

However, the robot does not know how to move in this manner, and needs your help!

**Task:** Using the functions moveNForward and TurnLeft, and loops as needed, have the robot move in an interesting quasi-spiral pattern with the outer dimension being 32. 
The robot should move 32 squares up (its starting orientation is upwards), turn left, move 31 squares leftwards, turn left again, move 30 squares down, and continue in 
this fashion until it forward just one square.  

**Hint:** At every iteration of the robot's motion, what operations occur? 

**Hint 2:** Use an indexing variable corresponding to the number of times the robot must move forward
