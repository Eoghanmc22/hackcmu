## Level 3: 

Congratulations advancing hacker! I am the Great Invisible Monster of Wasm and will destroy the robot if you do not have it pass through the waypoint. 
Save your friend by telling it how to reach the goal while still passing through the waypoint.

**Task:** First, create the function turn_left by calling turnRight multiple times. Then, call move, turnRight, and turnLeft 
repeatedly so that the robot passes through the waypoint on the right branch before reaching the goal.

**Hint:** What is the transformation between turnLeft and turnRight in terms of degrees turned?

**Sample Code Result:** This will define a function moveForwardTwice that calls the move function twice. Finally, the robot will move forward two squares when moveForwardTwice is called.
